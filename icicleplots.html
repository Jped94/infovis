<h2>What are Icicle Plots?</h2>

<p>Icicle Plots are a method for presenting hierarchical/clustered data. The technique was developed in 1983 by Kruskal and Landwher. It was originally presented in their paper "Icicle Plots: Better Displays for Hierarchical Clustering." They were named as such due to the fact that the clustering in the visualization looks like icicles.

<h2>Implementations</h2>
	<h3>Old School</h3>
	<p>In their paper, Kruskal and Landwher described a way to implement icicle plots with the simple plotters and computers they had back then. Here is their explanation of how it works: “In the icicle plot each vertical line topped by a label corresponds to an object. The label is repeated vertically with the symbol "&" used to separate successive copies, down to the level where the object becomes a singleton cluster. Each horizontal line in the icicle plot shows one level of the clustering, as illustrated on the right. Objects in the same cluster are joined by the symbol "=," while clusters are separated by a blank space. At the left of the line are a serial number and proximity level for this stage of the clustering.”
